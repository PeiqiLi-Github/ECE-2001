00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.723
I.

2 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:00:02.723 --> 00:00:06.600
The water supply is like a battery.

3 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.389
It gives you a voltage difference between the 2 terminals.

4 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.919
And because it said cartoon growing, it has infinite powers.

5 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.460
It can provide infinite current positive or negative.

6 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.480
But it can also provide 0 current. It all depends on what the circuit wants.

7 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.280
Register we discussed earlier the current and voltage relate to each other through owns law.

8 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.660
So, again, we are assuming that we are operating the resistor in a reasonable.

9 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.370
Voltage range and current range because if you go crazy, it voltage and current some resistance. They will start hitting up melting down.

10 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.980
You know, breaking up, so resistance will change as a function of temperature.

11 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.430
But right now we are, assuming that they are going to behave linearly, because we are going to be reasonable.

12 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.980
Okay, so Delta we equals to it is the voltage difference. You have to keep that in mind.

13 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.150
It is not the absolute voltage. It is. The difference between 2 terminals.

14 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.870
Okay, the voltage between the 2 terminals.

15 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:20.820
We started using the operation amplifiers in the lab as I mentioned it to you. This is a 5 terminal device.

16 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.380
Operation amplifier.

17 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.510
The lines around the operation amplifier are not circuit drawings.

18 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.560
You know, when I'm driving these triangles, that's a component.

19 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.100
It is not a wire that is drawn.

20 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.790
In a triangle with 5 other wires sticking out of it.

21 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.040
This is a component. Yes. People do make.

22 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.550
Interesting mistakes, so I have to clarify it as much as possible. So if this is the case.

23 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.290
For example, if I have a water supply.

24 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:11.580
Please see, I have a 9 voltage supply.

25 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.090
Connected to a 1 on Resistor.

26 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.630
How much time do I expect to run through this? 1? On resistance?

27 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:32.280
Finance why okay, let's assume that the bottom is my reference.

28 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.570
The bottom is my reference I said this is a 0 bolts, right?

29 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.360
It's an ideal wire. So what is the voltage here on this corner?

30 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.060
What is the voltage here on this corner?

31 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.430
What does the voltage up here? What is the voltage up here?

32 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.260
So, what is the voltage difference that is appearing across this resistor Delta week?

33 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.310
It is 9-0, right? We are.

34 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.480
Measuring it from the top to the bottom.

35 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.650
Because I am drawing my current in this direction. Okay let's call this.

36 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.750
I1, so I want equals to.

37 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:32.550
9 walls -0 waltz, divided by.

38 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.450
Delta V2 items are so I, is that you are.

39 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:49.380
Which is well, that makes i1 equals to 9.

40 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.380
Okay, so your partner decided that he is not going to measure.

41 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.860
In that direction is going to measure the current in this direction.

42 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.520
And instead of calling it, I want this article, I, to.

43 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:10.650
What is i2 negative? Right? Because the direction of that arrow means something.

44 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.310
The current flow has a direction it's like waterfall.

45 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.120
So, how would you do that? You would say that I, to.

46 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.810
Equals to the voltage.

47 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.449
Here 0-the voltage there.

48 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.559
You go from the base of the arrow to the tip of the arrow, right?

49 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:35.639
-9 walls divided by 1 on.

50 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:44.939
That it gets you a negative 9 amps. Is that cool?

51 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:48.779
Okay. All right. Let's see.

52 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:57.149
What is the current running through the supply in this direction? I'll call this. I tree.

53 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:14.759
Can I apply all law to a power supply? It's an ideal supply. Doesn't have any resistance.

54 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:33.719
So, how can I calculate the current running through the supply? You guys are convinced that I won is 9 AMS.

55 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:39.329
Where are these charges coming from? Right?

56 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:42.809
So, if there is, I want coming down like this.

57 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:52.979
This is also i1 does this mean that this is also.

58 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:05:52.979 --> 00:06:01.169
That means that this is also on 1, right? Because after going through the resistor, the current needs to continue.

59 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.519
So, I have a single loop here, so the current needs to loop around.

60 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:09.959
That this is what we would call a closed circuit.

61 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:18.269
In order to get a flow of charges, you need to have a closed circuit because in this course the devices that we deal with.

62 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:22.529
Will not store charge you will not store net charge.

63 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:26.099
I should say so no net charged storage.

64 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:43.439
So, what comes in must come out that makes sense.

65 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:50.099
Can I ask you another question? Okay.

66 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:10.229
Let's assume that I have 1 on here.

67 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:22.709
To own here and 3 on here and I want to know the current flowing through each of these elements.

68 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:49.709
How can we calculate this?

69 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:57.299
Okay.

70 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:07:57.299 --> 00:08:00.509
Let's assume that here, I have a reference.

71 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:07.679
That means that this voltage is here 0 volts right?

72 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:14.939
Okay, what is the voltage on this corner?

73 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:17.969
Okay, I have 9 walls.

74 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:23.669
That is applied from this point to this point.

75 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:31.019
How much resistance do I have between my 9 Volt point and 0 point.

76 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:08:31.019 --> 00:08:38.669
6, why because I have only a single branch.

77 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.659
Right. So if the current is entering from here.

78 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:47.249
It needs to go through this register 1 on resisted and 2 on.

79 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:08:47.249 --> 00:08:50.849
And 3 home resistor, and it needs to return back to my supply rate.

80 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:08:54.539 --> 00:08:57.899
The current is common in all of these resistors.

81 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:08:57.899 --> 00:09:08.849
So, let me call this. I not so, if that is the case, how does 3 and 4 release.

82 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:09:08.849 --> 00:09:12.479
They are equal, so I not equals to. I want.

83 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:09:12.479 --> 00:09:19.829
It goes to, he goes to who's the iPhone.

84 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:26.069
So, I want to write the arms law for the 1st Resistor. I will call the delta V.

85 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:30.149
1, what is that? Do we want equal to.

86 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:39.629
On current times the resistance value, right?

87 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:09:39.629 --> 00:09:44.399
What is my current I labeled it as 0.

88 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:52.799
Right, no, but I want to just write it. I just want to write the formula for it.

89 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:55.799
So, it's 0, at times.

90 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:09:55.799 --> 00:10:01.559
Uh, what is the value for the R.

91 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:06.239
Okay, what about the delta V for the 2nd 1 I'll tell you too.

92 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:17.399
The current is why not?

93 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:22.889
What about the resistor value?

94 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:32.399
Okay, what about the 3rd 1. okay. I am writing it like this right?

95 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:36.959
I am following the direction of my arrow. Like, my current is following in this direction.

96 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:40.769
So, I have the positive at the base of my arrow.

97 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:46.169
A negative at the tip of my arrow. This is called passive sign convention.

98 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:10:46.169 --> 00:10:50.219
So that's a victory.

99 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:10:58.109 --> 00:11:01.739
Okay, so if I go from.

100 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:11:01.739 --> 00:11:06.809
Starting from the 0 waltz here. What would you say? The voltages here?

101 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:11:10.889 --> 00:11:17.039
I start from 0, I increased my voltage by Delta v3 right?

102 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:22.949
So, that location is Delta v3. What is the absolute voltage here?

103 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:11:31.109 --> 00:11:36.989
It is Delta v3+V 2.

104 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:11:36.989 --> 00:11:43.949
Right because I had a voltage difference and I added another Walter's difference on top of it.

105 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:56.699
What is the voltage up here in terms of the activities? Right? It was Delta victory.

106 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:11:56.699 --> 00:12:04.619
Plus now we're gonna add that the v1.

107 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:12:04.619 --> 00:12:09.329
So, we went from 0 waltz to the 9 vault node.

108 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:12:09.329 --> 00:12:14.519
And said that it should be equal to the sum of all these voltage drops.

109 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:22.799
Across these resistors make sense. So fine. Yeah.

110 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:29.849
Hello.

111 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:38.159
Hm.

112 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:45.599
Positive sign means that it is higher, right?

113 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:49.709
Of course, the can come out to be a negative number.

114 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:53.729
But Walter's difference is measured from positive to the negative from.

115 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:12:53.729 --> 00:12:59.249
That's the convention, so if I were to add these 3.

116 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:12:59.249 --> 00:13:09.059
That's what would that be equal to.

117 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:15.419
It's going to be 6 homes.

118 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:21.539
Units are very important. I not. And that is equal to.

119 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:33.689
9 waltz -0 loss, right? So, if that is the case, can you calculate? I not.

120 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:49.559
So, it's gonna be 3 over 2.

121 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:53.669
Okay.

122 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:13:56.669 --> 00:14:02.129
Is it clear so far? Let's do.

123 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:14:02.129 --> 00:14:08.879
Instead of calculating it this way, let's calculate the equivalent resistance of the serious combination.

124 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:12.599
How did we calculate the current resistance in a serious combination?

125 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:29.849
So, I'm gonna draw my circuit again. I'll say that this is 9 walls and this is my articles. So, how do I calculate my article?

126 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:14:29.849 --> 00:14:34.559
There's nothing branching out. Everything is a single branch, right? So.

127 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:39.299
It's going to be the sum of the resistors. Okay. 1 on.

128 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:14:39.299 --> 00:14:45.299
+2 OEMs +3 homes, which makes.

129 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:51.869
6 homes. Okay. Let's calculate our. I not.

130 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:14:51.869 --> 00:15:03.689
That is the current that is running through this loop. What is the voltage difference across the equivalence resistance?

131 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:15:03.689 --> 00:15:09.929
If this is my reference here, this is 0 volts, 9 walls and 9 walls here.

132 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:24.659
9 months across the register, so Delta V equals to 9 walls that is equal to times are equivalent right?

133 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:29.909
So, I notice then what 9 was divided by 6 homes.

134 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:15:34.739 --> 00:15:40.739
Did you work out the same way? Yeah.

135 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:45.449
Okay, so far, so good.

136 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:15:48.569 --> 00:16:08.569
Okay, let's change a little bit.

137 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:19.139
You are asked to calculate this current I.

138 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:16:22.169 --> 00:16:29.609
How would you go about calculating it? What do we need to know?

139 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:16:29.609 --> 00:16:38.579
To calculate the current in a resistor yeah, if we know the voltage difference.

140 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:16:38.579 --> 00:16:42.329
And the resistance, we can calculate that current.

141 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:16:42.329 --> 00:16:47.849
So, what we want to know is this difference, right?

142 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:16:47.849 --> 00:16:57.689
Or I could just leave with, right because if I.

143 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:16:57.689 --> 00:17:02.969
Show the + and - and have the voltage there means that it is the difference between.

144 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:17:02.969 --> 00:17:10.529
These 2 points, can you guys calculate this? 1?

145 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:17.339
Why is it here? Why do the Walter just cancel each other?

146 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:27.779
Charts the voltage levels, right? Potential that. Okay.

147 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:17:27.779 --> 00:17:33.059
Let's go through this step by step. I put a reference at the bottom.

148 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:17:33.059 --> 00:17:40.349
I don't have to, but I did what is the voltage of my reference?

149 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:17:40.349 --> 00:17:46.709
What is the voltage here? What is the voltage here?

150 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:17:46.709 --> 00:17:51.749
What about here? What about here?

151 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:17:56.849 --> 00:18:00.239
So, what is the voltage defense react?

152 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:18:05.009 --> 00:18:14.699
So, the current I equals to we X over 1:1:which is.

153 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:18:14.699 --> 00:18:22.229
Is it good?

154 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:18:25.289 --> 00:18:30.659
Okay easy. All right. Let's get harder than.

155 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:18:34.829 --> 00:18:51.689
I want you to remain quiet and solve this all by yourself.

156 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:18:51.689 --> 00:19:03.269
1st, I would like to talk with.

157 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:19:37.769 --> 00:19:48.269
How is this different than the previous case? 1 of them is flipped.

158 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:19:48.269 --> 00:19:58.019
Okay, so if you assume that the bottom is your reference again.

159 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:19:58.019 --> 00:20:07.529
What does the voltage 0 walls on this call corner here?

160 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:20:07.529 --> 00:20:15.629
On this corner here, top left.

161 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:20:15.629 --> 00:20:19.499
Upright negative 9.

162 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:20:19.499 --> 00:20:24.209
Why is that? Polarity is flipped.

163 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:20:24.209 --> 00:20:32.669
Okay, so what does it say for IV then? Right? Starting voltage.

164 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:38.579
Ending voltage starting voltage is 9 walls ending voltages.

165 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:20:38.579 --> 00:20:46.469
-9 volts divided by the resistance value, right?

166 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:20:46.469 --> 00:20:51.239
That makes 18.

167 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:20:57.989 --> 00:21:03.929
So, what is the voltage drop across that resisted again?

168 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:07.529
18 months. Okay. So.

169 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:21:07.529 --> 00:21:13.559
If I were to calculate the voltage drops.

170 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:18.029
I'd say assume that I am looking at a voltage drop here.

171 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:26.849
That's only 1 Delta.

172 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:21:26.849 --> 00:21:32.789
That'll be 3 if I go around this loop.

173 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:36.239
And summing all the voltage drops.

174 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:21:36.239 --> 00:21:44.609
I would say that to be 1.

175 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:21:44.609 --> 00:21:48.119
Plus That'll be 2.

176 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:58.019
That'll be tree I went from this point to this point from this point to this point and this point to this point.

177 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:21:58.019 --> 00:22:05.699
I sound old, the voltage drops. What should that be equal to.

178 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:18.419
When you go around the closed loop and you arrive in the same location.

179 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:22:18.419 --> 00:22:24.749
The voltage drops build at the 0.

180 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:22:24.749 --> 00:22:29.609
Let's do that to see if that is the case. What is my Delta? V1.

181 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:22:33.389 --> 00:22:37.769
Is it look at the polarity of my data v1 and the polarity of the supply.

182 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:22:42.749 --> 00:22:48.059
All right look at this and look at this.

183 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:22:48.059 --> 00:22:53.639
So 1 is 1 negative 9 walls.

184 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:22:53.639 --> 00:22:58.919
What is that v2? We calculated that.

185 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:22:58.919 --> 00:23:04.679
What is that the way to 18 months? Right? We know the current 18 apps.

186 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:23:13.439 --> 00:23:23.969
What about the retreat? Is it.

187 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:23:29.129 --> 00:23:42.599
Is that true?

188 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:47.729
-9 volts +18 times 1 on that gives you what.

189 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:23:54.689 --> 00:23:58.349
18 walts -9.

190 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:23:58.349 --> 00:24:02.429
Is that 0? Yeah.

191 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:24:02.429 --> 00:24:11.789
Uh, because the way that I am going, I am going from.

192 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:16.229
This point to this point, and I am calculated in voltage drop.

193 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:24:16.229 --> 00:24:21.959
But the water is increasing, right?

194 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:24:21.959 --> 00:24:27.389
So, if your voltage is increasing 9 walls, it means that the drop is negative. 9.

195 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:32.459
And when you are going from this point here, at this point.

196 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:24:32.459 --> 00:24:37.469
The resisted does drop the voltage, right?

197 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:24:37.469 --> 00:24:42.989
Okay, do you know what this is known as.

198 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:24:42.989 --> 00:24:52.679
Your costs because voltage law.

199 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:58.439
Which means that in any closed loop, it doesn't matter which, which way if you arrive in the same location.

200 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:24:58.439 --> 00:25:03.329
You are at the same height, or are you are at the same voltage?

201 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:25:03.329 --> 00:25:07.859
For example, if you go around campus, assume that we have some.

202 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:25:07.859 --> 00:25:11.159
No hills and valleys and whatever.

203 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:25:11.159 --> 00:25:19.859
And then you are walking in any complex way that you, you walked.

204 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:25:19.859 --> 00:25:23.219
Sometimes go up a hill, you sometimes come down the hill.

205 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:25:23.219 --> 00:25:26.489
But if you are in the same position, at the end.

206 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:25:26.489 --> 00:25:32.159
Your net change in height is 0, does that make sense?

207 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:25:36.929 --> 00:25:43.229
Okay, it is a little to trivial with a single loop like this, but it helps when you have a complex situation.

208 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:25:43.229 --> 00:25:59.069
Yeah, so in every the drop will be negative.

209 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:25:59.069 --> 00:26:05.189
So many Mm hmm. Look at another example.

210 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:26:39.749 --> 00:26:48.089
It's calculates this current here called the sign ons.

211 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:27:11.399 --> 00:27:14.489
If you want to use the kickoffs voltage law.

212 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:27:14.489 --> 00:27:20.159
We will say we can sum all the voltage drops.

213 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:28.649
And said it equal to 0 So assume that.

214 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:27:28.649 --> 00:27:32.009
I declared this point as my reference here.

215 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:27:32.009 --> 00:27:37.169
I don't have to, but I did.

216 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:27:37.169 --> 00:27:40.409
Starting from this point going here.

217 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:47.999
How much does the voltage drop they get in 1 Walt.

218 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:52.709
Because as you were going in our loop, we entered at the negative terminal, right?

219 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:27:57.839 --> 00:28:02.549
So, it's negative 1, Walt. Okay. And then from going from this point.

220 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:06.389
To this point, how much did we drop in voltage.

221 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:13.169
Again, we encountered a negative sign. 1st right?

222 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:28:13.169 --> 00:28:19.169
So the drop is negative 2 volts.

223 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:28:19.169 --> 00:28:22.649
Now, going from this middle node to the top right? Corner.

224 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:28:22.649 --> 00:28:26.729
How much are we dropping.

225 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:28:26.729 --> 00:28:30.029
Right. So we are dropping 5 volts.

226 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:43.229
Posted firewalls drop. Now, we arrived here on the stop corner.

227 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:28:43.229 --> 00:28:47.189
And we want to go down here and we need to know this voltage drop here. Right?

228 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:28:47.189 --> 00:28:55.769
That Toby, I'll call this.

229 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:28:55.769 --> 00:28:59.849
So I say, plus we X.

230 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:28:59.849 --> 00:29:04.979
Because I went from the positive sign.

231 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:29:04.979 --> 00:29:11.759
So, the negative sign, right? As I was looking this equals to.

232 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:29:11.759 --> 00:29:21.449
Did we arrive in the same point when we arrive here? Is there any voltage drop between this point? At this point?

233 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:29:21.449 --> 00:29:29.789
No, it's an ideal wire, so it's equal potential. So, what is this equal to.

234 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:35.339
0, nice round number. It's a joke.

235 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:29:35.339 --> 00:29:41.519
Thank you.

236 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:29:41.519 --> 00:29:45.509
So we need to do some math here. What is in terms of find out.

237 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:29:52.649 --> 00:30:00.179
Look at the direction of the arrow or not, it goes in this direction, right?

238 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:30:00.179 --> 00:30:05.699
So, it is going from the positive to the negative, right right.

239 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:30:05.699 --> 00:30:11.009
So we say we X equals to at times 2 homes.

240 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:16.619
Because the direction of the arrow matches, the positive to negative, right? If it was reversed, we will put a negative sign.

241 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:30:16.619 --> 00:30:19.619
Okay, so we X is I not.

242 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:30:19.619 --> 00:30:25.799
Times jobs. So what is I not.

243 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:30:32.459 --> 00:30:41.639
What these add up to this is 2 walls, right?

244 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:45.359
So, I articles to what you need to throw that to the other side.

245 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:58.139
And what what do I do? Do I do it?

246 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:07.739
What is negative towards divide by tombs? M.

247 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:31:07.739 --> 00:31:16.739
Units are extremely important if you're calculating a current and get units of voltage, it means that you made a mistake somewhere.

248 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:31:16.739 --> 00:31:21.509
And also order of magnitude is very important.

249 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:26.669
If somebody promises you, 100,000 dollars salary and gives you 100 dollars per year.

250 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:31.889
You will be upset. All right.

251 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:36.629
So, it is not like, oh, it's just units. It means something.

252 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:39.869
Are you good with this? Okay.

253 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:31:39.869 --> 00:31:45.179
So, water supplies, ideal, water supplies, give you a voltage difference.

254 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:31:45.179 --> 00:31:49.889
It is not the absolute voltage. Does it make sense?

255 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:31:49.889 --> 00:31:55.529
So, when we went up and around, we calculated a voltage what was the voltage here?

256 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:31:55.529 --> 00:32:01.139
At this bottom corner here 0 walls, what is the voltage up here?

257 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:08.789
Tools because the voltage up here.

258 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:15.629
Was 1, Walt, this voltage here was 3 volts.

259 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:32:15.629 --> 00:32:32.249
Was it so we increased from 0 to 1 Volt, right?

260 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:32:32.249 --> 00:32:37.289
Then from 1 would be 1 to 3 volts.

261 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:40.559
And from 3 walls, we went down to minus tools.

262 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:45.449
Because of the polarity of that ideal supply, you can think of them as batteries.

263 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:32:45.449 --> 00:32:49.139
You know, when you have a TV reboot, you have the double a batteries.

264 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:32:49.139 --> 00:32:53.759
We don't put them right? It doesn't work right?

265 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:32:53.759 --> 00:33:00.059
1 has to go up there on us to go down now, is some of the batteries, but it looks like they're both point in the same way.

266 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:33:00.059 --> 00:33:07.769
but basically what you are doing is then you are putting the two double a batteries in series 

267 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:33:07.769 --> 00:33:12.779
Cool. So fine. Yes. Okay.

268 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:33:12.779 --> 00:33:17.819
As you practice, this will become this natural. All right let's see.

269 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:33:22.769 --> 00:33:34.859
I have a 9 year old supply.

270 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:33:34.859 --> 00:33:44.879
And I have 2:1:on resistors. I want to know the current in the 1st results there.

271 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:33:44.879 --> 00:33:50.189
2nd resistor and I also want to know this current here.

272 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:33:50.189 --> 00:34:10.189
And this current here.

273 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:34:10.189 --> 00:34:20.909
What do I do?

274 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:27.149
Find the total current full resistance.

275 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:34.139
Go step by step and I declare this bottom as my reference.

276 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:40.259
Yes, we can 0 falls. What is the Walter chair?

277 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:34:40.259 --> 00:34:47.129
What's the voltage here? It's the voltage of here.

278 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:34:47.129 --> 00:34:51.419
Here here.

279 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:34:56.759 --> 00:35:00.329
Do you know the voltage difference between the 1st, 1 on register?

280 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:35:17.309 --> 00:35:23.099
So, what is that to be 1? It's gonna be 9 walls.

281 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:35:23.099 --> 00:35:28.889
Minus firewalls 9 months.

282 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:35:36.839 --> 00:35:48.269
So you can calculate 1 yes.

283 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:35:48.269 --> 00:36:00.239
What does that want? How do I calculated.

284 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:36:00.239 --> 00:36:11.039
Voltage drop divided by the resistance. What about the 2nd, 1 i2?

285 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:36:20.099 --> 00:36:25.829
So, if I want an i2 or 9 each, what is.

286 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:36:35.939 --> 00:36:39.299
18 AMS why do you say that?

287 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:36:47.669 --> 00:36:53.519
You need to supply this I want current through the 1st resistance, right?

288 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:36:53.519 --> 00:36:59.249
I need to supply I took her through the 2nd resistance and where does this come from?

289 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:36:59.249 --> 00:37:05.159
You have some income, right? We cannot spend what you don't have.

290 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:13.019
Into a balanced budget, you have to have income encourage.

291 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:37:13.019 --> 00:37:19.169
That satisfies the article.

292 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:37:19.169 --> 00:37:24.989
So you can say that I4 needs to be equal to.

293 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:37:24.989 --> 00:37:32.549
I for is the incoming current to this node here?

294 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:37:32.549 --> 00:37:42.929
It needs to equal to 1.

295 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:37:42.929 --> 00:37:56.789
I too. Does that make sense?

296 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:37:56.789 --> 00:38:03.119
So, we've calculated I wanna 9:2:9 M +9.

297 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:08.609
The answer is 18 X. so what is this known as.

298 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.870
Kickoffs current law kirchhoff's current law says.

299 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:28.260
Says if you have a node and you have branches coming out of it.

300 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:32.910
However, many and you have currents.

301 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.970
Going out like this pointing out.

302 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:41.550
Some of all the currents leaving.

303 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:54.390
As to be 0, in this case, I said, I focused I want plus I, too, because I feel is drawn as accurate. That is.

304 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:38:54.390 --> 00:39:02.520
Arriving there, I could have written that as instead of I could have said.

305 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:07.410
I have a current here that I label as I not.

306 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:10.890
Leaving that note, then you would say.

307 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:19.560
I not plus i1+I too, because 0.

308 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:26.190
Kick off current law saying that all the currents leaving that note has the sum to 0.

309 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:35.340
Because I don't have any way to store charges. There there is the charge generation or elimination.

310 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:39.390
But I not in terms of i4.

311 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:48.720
What is it? Right? So.

312 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.080
I not is just negative.

313 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:56.850
I for cause, I flipped the direction of the arrow.

314 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:10.800
Is that cool? Still too easy? Yes. Oh, man.

315 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:30.800
Ask is 1 it harder. I know. 1 world.

316 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.190
1, on 2 homes, 3 homes.

317 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:38.370
And say 4 walls, you.

318 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:48.930
I would like to know is current here.

319 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:16.590
What do you do cry.

320 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:26.130
Don't cry every time.

321 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:29.160
Okay, and let's take a reference. Okay.

322 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:33.030
We pick a reference that's the rules.

323 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:39.150
What is the voltage here voltage up here?

324 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:49.410
What is the voltage down here on this bottom corner? What is the voltage up here?

325 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:02.700
What is the voltage here? You need to confess.

326 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:11.670
You don't know and if you don't know something, what do you do?

327 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:19.200
Right away you labeled it with some thing like.

328 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:29.460
And I know right we X and then you use the scariest thing that came out of Middle East.

329 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:34.980
What does that algebra?

330 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:40.650
Never heard of this joke before no, the scariest thing for a lot of students.

331 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:46.650
Okay, so.

332 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:50.430
Assuming that we can calculate.

333 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:58.560
The different current I will label this 1 as I want and this 1 as i2.

334 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:07.440
You could say that i1+I not plus i2 equals to what?

335 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:12.180
Now, can we calculate each of these currents.

336 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:17.670
Using the, the voltages that I have labeled.

337 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:28.020
For example, what is starting voltage is what.

338 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:35.190
The ex, what is the ending voltage for.

339 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:41.010
That is my voltage difference right? Divided by the resistance value.

340 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:45.960
What is the registered value? .

341 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.350
What about I not what is my starting voltage?

342 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:43:54.180 --> 00:44:01.980
What is the ending voltage divided by.

343 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:05.730
+4 i2 starting voltage.

344 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:17.220
Ending voltage divided by.

345 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:25.020
This needs to equal to 1 equation, wanna know.

346 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.560
Can you do it? How do you do it?

347 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:40.710
Can I multiply both sides with OEMs and what would that do.

348 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:51.660
I canceled the homes from the denominator because I can multiply both sides by ohms. Right? 0 times owns is what.

349 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:58.470
0, okay so what do I have here?

350 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:03.600
I have something divided by 1, something divided by 2 something divide by 3.

351 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:08.940
Guys know, fractions those who did not know fractions.

352 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:17.400
Did not arrive here, but they did arrive at. You can.

353 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:22.500
Try to have a conversation with some of the math faculty you will know.

354 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:32.730
Okay, so what do I do? Not everybody has to know fractions. I mean, it's not the most.

355 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:36.480
What do you guys need to know? What do I do.

356 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:47.490
I multiplied the 1st term by 8th term by.

357 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:53.490
Turn my 2 that gets me what.

358 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:56.700
6 x -6 walls.

359 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.910
.

360 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:05.040
-0 walls +2 weeks.

361 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:12.450
-8 volts divided by.

362 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:17.610
6, it goes to 0.

363 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:24.540
Yes, okay. Now.

364 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:33.480
Can I cross multiply 6:2:dATA science that goes away then? Right?

365 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.480
So, what do we have here? How many is Lucy?

366 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:49.410
How do you see? I see 6 X here.

367 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:57.420
3 weeks here and 2 weeks here, how much does it make.

368 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:00.990
11 okay, 11.

369 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:07.020
Is the number it's a nice number.

370 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:17.880
And then when we X equals to what? So we to.

371 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:34.050
But the question is not asking for, why did we do this? Because you can relate to the X.

372 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:38.640
Was a joke too. Okay.

373 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:45.930
We X is what, what are we after.

374 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:50.610
Why not? So, what is the X in terms of? What.

375 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:47:54.780 --> 00:48:01.440
Current times the resistance, so I think goes to.

376 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.800
We, that is equal to.

377 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:17.700
Which is 7, 11.

378 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.850
Okay.

379 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:25.140
What did we do in this approach that we took.

380 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:30.510
What was the step by step? Technically used.

381 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:39.990
We chose the reference, right? Then we labeled.

382 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:53.610
Unknown voltages then what did we do.

383 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:48:53.610 --> 00:49:03.300
Cost current law, which is some, all the currents leaving and all the notes.

384 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:10.650
To 0, in this case, we had only 1 note to calculate. So there was only 1 calculation.

385 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:20.550
And what is this technique known as node voltage?

386 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:30.990
Technique it works in very complex circuits, too.

387 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:42.090
If you are able to label the known voltages an unknown voltages, you can construct all these equations.

388 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:48.390
This was the ideal water supply, but there is also an ideal current supply.

389 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:49:48.390 --> 00:50:00.600
Okay, just 3rd, ideal cure supply can supply any current regardless of voltage.

390 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:26.580
So the voltage can be 0, can be 1 can be negative 1. it can be negative infinity, positive infinity, whatever.

391 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:29.820
Sometimes when I say whatever, it's serious as soon as 0.

392 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:36.780
It doesn't have to be 0, it can be 0, an ideal current supply will supply the current.

393 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:42.510
And we will do more exercises like this later today.

394 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:48.300
Okay, if you have any questions I have office hours can walk with me.

395 "Gokirmak, Ali" (3436017152)
00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:53.490
Thank you for coming Thank you.
